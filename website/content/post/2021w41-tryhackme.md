I just started on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/wastebasket) with 'Hacking for Fun'. It looks like I could learn a lot about Cyber Security in a fun way, almost like playing a game.

[`pzzl`](/tags/pzzl/) is updated to install **CyberSecurity** tools with Ansible.

I know all the cool kids use [**Kali Linux**](https://www.kali.org/), but 
[**Debian**](https://www.debian.org/) is my trusted distribution sinds [Debian 2.2 (Potato)](https://www.debian.org/releases/potato/) in 2000.
